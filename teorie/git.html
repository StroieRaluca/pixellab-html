<p>Commits
    A commit is like a snapshot of the code at a given time, every commit has its unique hash (or commit ID) which
    allows us to identify who made changes to our files and when.
    <br />
    A commit must have a message that is first of all descriptive of what we are trying to do with our current commit,
    for example fixed_home_crash or added_automated_logout.
    <br />
    In order to make a new commit, we need to mark specific files that we want to change as “staged for commit” To mark
    files as need to change aka to stage them for the commit, we use the git add command followed by path[s] to the
    file[s] or regular expressions that match the files.

<h3>Branches</h3>
<p>Branches are a way of making a copy of the current state of the repository, to allow us to develop certain features
    independent of other changes added to the code.
